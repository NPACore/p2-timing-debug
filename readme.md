# Time differences between MR task trigger and DICOM Acq time


## Overview
This repository demonstrates pulling task onset times from two independent sources, the task display computer and the scan computer, to check for mismatches as a result of erroneously missing TTL TR triggers (`=` sent to start the task).

We can combine the two sources useing participant ID, session date, task name, and run number to explore timing differences.

Unfortunately, we cannot directly compare onset times because the computer clocks are not synced. But that can be tackled two different ways

  1. With enough display onset + MR onset pairs, we can model the offset and dift between the clocks.
  2. For sessions with multiple back-to-back tasks or runs, for example the `AntiSaccade` task herein, we can compare the MR-display offset from run1 to run2 to check the task start time onsets. **If TTL was not sent when expected, this difference of differences will be non-zero and greater than the TR of the task acquisition**.


See [`Makefile`](Makefile) for recipes for both.


Computer clocks drift [due to frequency error](https://www.ntp.org/ntpfaq/ntp-s-sw-clocks-quality/)
> Even if the systematic error of a clock model is known, the clock will never be perfect. This is because the frequency varies over time, mostly influenced by temperature, ... or magnetic fields.
> ... oscillatorâ€™s correction value increases by about 11 PPM..
> .. 12 PPM correspond to one second per day 

## Modeling drift

  * MR clock start time for all `epfid2d1` (bold EPI) are in [`txt/mr_times_p2.tsv`](txt/mr_times_p2.tsv).
  * an example for parsing eprime logs is in [`extract_eprime.pl`](extract_eprime.pl).
  * pairing the two (WIP) in [`merge.R`](merge.R). Currently (20241223), [`model_time.R`](model_time.R) has the most insight into the clock drift.

MR time is moved into UTC timezone to avoid daylight savings time jumps. Still, the drift has discrete jumps likely from one clock being adjusted manually.
